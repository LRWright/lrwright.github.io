    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Hi, My name is Le-Ann</h2>
    <p>I am a trainee web developer. I love solving problems with code and finding the most efficient way to do things.
    </p>
    <p> When I'm not coding I am gaming or hiking. I love exploring new places both virtual and real.</p>
    <p> I worked in IT for 9 years as helpdesk and then system support administrator using SQL.
        </br> I worked alongside the dev team helping them fix minor issues so they could focus on more important tasks.
        </br>I now want to be able to work on the important tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>How am I learning Web development?</h2>
    <p>I am currently on a 12 week Bootcamp program with <a
            href="https://wearecodenation.com/virtual-learning/">CodeNation</a>.</p>
    <p>I also use free resources such as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="Youtube.com">Youtube</a>. 
    </br>The best way I have found to learn is to have an idea of the basics then find a project you like and work on that.</p>
